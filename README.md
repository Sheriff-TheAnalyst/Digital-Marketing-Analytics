## Business Overview/Problem
FreshCart, like many e-commerce platforms, relies heavily on online advertising to acquire new customers and retain existing ones. However, in the midst of an increasingly competitive market and fluctuating ad costs, the company has identified two main challenges:
 
**A. Inefficient Ad Spend** The company suspects that not every dollar spent on digital advertising is yielding the desired ROI. Some campaigns may be costing more than they return in revenue.
 
**B. Identifying Effective Channels:** With multiple platforms available for advertising, from search engines to social media, FreshCart is finding it challenging to determine which channels offer the best return on investment.
 
As the competition in the online grocery sector has skyrocketed, the cost of customer acquisition is rising. FreshCart is looking for the most efficient way to save cost and optimize its digital ad spend.


## Rationale for the Project
Marketing analytics is the process of using data to understand how marketing campaigns perform and find how to improve them. It helps businesses know which strategies work best, where to spend money, and how to better connect with customers.
By analyzing the performance of different advertising channels, FreshCart can:
 
A. Identify demography or regions where the ads perform best.
 
B. Understand which campaigns are under or over-funded and reallocate funds accordingly.
 
C. Determine which platforms or strategies yield the highest return


## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to analyze FreshCart past advertising data and create a strategy to optimize their digital ad spending. The specific objectives are:
 
A. Evaluate the effectiveness of current advertising campaigns across platforms.
 
B. Identify top-performing channels for advertising.
 
C. Assess demography engagement and conversion rates.
 
D. Recommend strategies for better budget allocation.
